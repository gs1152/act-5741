Deliveries of the ES8 in April 2019 were 1,124 vehicles, reflecting a greater-than-anticipated slowdown in monthly deliveries mainly due to the reduction in the electric vehicle subsidy and slow macro-economic conditions in China caused by the trade war with the US. Total aggregate deliveries as of April 30, 2019 were 16,461 vehicles.

On May 20, 2019, the company’s GAC-NIO joint venture announced its new brand, Hycan He Chuang, and plans to launch its first vehicle model this year.

In June, NIO’s second production model, the ES6, a 5-seater high-performance premium electric SUV, will roll off the production line and the first deliveries to NIO users will begin in the same month. The company currently has over 12,000 ES6 pre-orders.

Outlook
For the second quarter, NIO expects the sales environment to be more challenging and anticipates an overall sequential decrease in demand and deliveries, as competition accelerates and the general automobile market in China remains muted. Against this backdrop, NIO is focusing on improving its overall network utilization and operating efficiencies.

For the second quarter of 2019, NIO expects total revenues to be RMB1,134 million to RMB1,294 million ($169-193 million), down approx. 20.7-30.5% from the first quarter of 2019.
