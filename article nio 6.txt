Recent Developments
Deliveries of the ES8 in October 2018 reached 1,573 vehicles. October deliveries were partially impacted by the
seven-day Golden Week national holiday, during which the deliveries were slowed down for vehicle registration office
closures and the Company made production line modifications to accommodate ES6 production, the 5-seater premium
SUV targeted for launch by the end of 2018.
CEO and CFO Comments
“The third quarter 2018 marked multiple milestones for NIO in the journey to achieve our ‘blue sky coming’ vision,” said William Li,
Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NIO Inc. “We completed our first full quarter of production and delivery of the
ES8 and successfully executed the Company’s initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.”
Mr. Li continued, “We have delivered 4,941 ES8s to users in over 170 cities in China by the end of October 2018. NIO Power has
successfully supported initial needs of ES8 users and NIO Service has exceeded expectations. We have been receiving valuable
feedback from the NIO community, represented by increasing active users of NIO APP, and the NIO brand is gaining acceptance
as a premium brand. Our focus remains resolute to deliver vehicles with the highest quality, to improve the holistic experience and
to prepare for the launch of the ES6, the Company’s five-seater electric SUV. ”
Louis T. Hsieh, NIO’s Chief Financial Officer, added “We delivered solid results in the third quarter of 2018 as production
accelerated and we began generating meaningful revenue of over RMB1.4 billion. We now have 12 NIO Houses and 9 pop-up
NIO Houses across 19 major cities in China. Our ES8 order pipeline continues to grow and production is on track, giving us
confidence in our ability to meet our delivery goal of 10,000 ES8s by the end of 2018.”
Financial Results for the Third Quarter of 2018
Revenues
Total revenues in the third quarter of 2018 were RMB1,469.6 million (US$214.0 million), representing an increase of
3,095.3% from the second quarter of 2018.
Vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2018 were RMB1,426.9 million (US$207.8 million), representing an increase of
3,113.8% from the second quarter of 2018. The increase in vehicle sales over the second quarter of 2018 was attributed to
accelerated deliveries of the ES8 in the third quarter. Deliveries for the second quarter of 2018 represent deliveries made
during the 3-day period from June 28 to June 30, 2018.
Other sales in the third quarter of 2018 were RMB42.7 million (US$6.2 million), representing an increase of 2,581.8% from
the second quarter of 2018. The increase in other sales over the second quarter of 2018 was mainly attributed to
increased revenues recognized from the home chargers installed in the third quarter.
Cost of Sales and Gross Margin
Cost of sales in the third quarter of 2018 was RMB1,585.9 million (US$230.9 million), representing an increase of 696.2%
from the second quarter of 2018. The increase in cost of sales over the second quarter of 2018 was mainly driven by the
substantial delivery volume increase of ES8s in the quarter.
Gross margin in the third quarter of 2018 was negative 7.9%, compared with negative 333.1% in the second quarter of
2018, mainly driven by the larger scale of production and deliveries of the ES8.
Operating Expenses 
Research and development expenses in the third quarter of 2018 were RMB1,023.4 million (US$149.0 million),
representing an increase of 37.0% from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 33.7% from the second quarter of
2018. Excluding share-based compensation expenses (non-GAAP), research and development expenses were RMB947.3
million (US$137.9 million), representing an increase of 27.5% from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 24.4% from
the second quarter of 2018. The increase in research and development expenses over the second quarter of 2018 was
primarily attributed to increased share-based compensation expenses recognized related to the stock options granted to
the Company’s non-US employees with a performance condition of an IPO and an increased number of personnel related
to product and software development teams, as well as increased development expenses of the ES6, the five-seater
premium electric SUV, expected to be launched by the end of 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2018 were RMB1,670.1 million (US$243.2 million),
representing an increase of 208.9% from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 74.6% from the second quarter of
2018. Excluding share-based compensation expenses (non-GAAP), selling, general and administrative expenses were
RMB1,322.1 million (US$192.5 million), representing an increase of 150.7% from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase
of 47.5% from the second quarter of 2018. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses over the second
quarter of 2018 was primarily attributed to increased share-based compensation expenses recognized related to the stock
options granted to the Company’s non-US employees with a performance condition of an IPO and an increased number of
the personnel related to user development and service related teams, as well as increased selling expenses for test drives
and other promotional events.
Operating Income/Loss and Operating Margin
Loss from operations in the third quarter of 2018 was RMB2,809.9 million (US$409.1 million), representing an increase of
118.2% from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 49.9% from the second quarter of 2018. Excluding share-based
compensation expenses, adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP) was RMB2,377.7 million (US$346.2 million) in the third
quarter, representing an increase of 87.2% from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 31.3% from the second
quarter of 2018.

161.8%, compared with negative 3,938.9% in the second quarter of 2018.
Share-based Compensation Expenses

an increase of 2,380.6% from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 581.2% from the second quarter of 2018. The
increase in share-based compensation expenses was primarily attributed to the share-based compensation expenses

which was satisfied in the third quarter of 2018. 
Net Income/Loss and Earnings Per Share
Net loss was RMB2,810.4 million (US$409.2 million) in the third quarter of 2018, representing an increase of 116.1% from

respectively in the third quarter of 2018, among which, accretion on convertible redeemable preferred shares to redemption
value will no longer recur after the convertible redeemable preferred shares converted to ordinary shares after the initial
public offering of the Company on September 12, 2018. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, accretion on
convertible redeemable preferred shares to redemption value and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to
redemption value, adjusted net loss attributable to NIO’s ordinary shareholders (non-GAAP) was RMB2,370.2 million
(US$345.1 million).

Non-GAAP Disclosure
The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as non-GAAP cost of sales, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP loss from
operations, non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP basic loss per weighted average number of
ordinary shares and non-GAAP basic loss per ADS, in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decisionmaking purposes. By excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, accretion on convertible redeemable preferred
shares to redemption value and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, the Company believes that
the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business and enhance the overall understanding of the
Company’s past performance and future prospects. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures allow for
greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.
The non-GAAP financial measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP
methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical
tools and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a
substitute for net loss or other consolidated statements of comprehensive loss data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The
Company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial
measure.
The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP
performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.
For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Reconciliation of GAAP and
non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release.

may be, at any particular rate or at all.
