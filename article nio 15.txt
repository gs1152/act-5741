New Product Announcements

On December 28, 2019, the third NIO Day was held in Shenzhen, China. The Company announced the 100-kWh battery pack and 20-kW DC Power Home. Deliveries of 100-kWh battery pack are estimated to begin in 2020 Q4 and expected to significantly improve the driving range of all NIO vehicle models. Aided by the Company’s proprietary battery-swap technologies, NIO offers its users flexible battery upgrade programs, making “Battery as a Service” a unique value proposition.
 
At this event, the Company unveiled its third production model, the EC6, a smart premium electric coupe SUV. The EC6 performance version is equipped with a 160-kW permanent magnet motor and a 240-kW induction motor and capable of accelerating from zero to 100 kph in just 4.7 seconds. With the 100-kWh battery pack, the EC6 performance version boasts an NEDC range of up to 615 km. NIO plans to announce the prices and specifications of EC6 in July and the delivery is expected to begin in September 2020.
 
During the NIO Day, the Company released the all-new ES8, the flagship smart premium electric SUV. With the 100-kWh battery pack, the all-new ES8 has an NEDC range of up to 580 km, a major improvement in its range performance. The Company plans to commence deliveries of the new ES8 in April 2020.
CEO and CFO Comments

“NIO delivered a total of 4,799 ES8 and ES6 vehicles in the third quarter of 2019, representing a 35.1% increase from the second quarter. The electric vehicle sector experienced substantial softness in the second half of 2019 after the reduction of EV subsidies in China. Despite the challenges, NIO’s sales improved solidly since September,” said William Bin Li, founder, chairman and chief executive officer of NIO. “Our strong performance was attributable to the competitiveness of our products and services, the recognition and strong support from our user community, and our sales network expansion strategy as we continue to launch more efficient NIO Spaces. We expect over 8,000 vehicles to be delivered in the fourth quarter, a record of quarterly deliveries in our history. With that, the total aggregate deliveries in 2019 are estimated to reach over 20,300.

“On December 28, we hosted our third annual NIO Day, dedicated to and for, our user community. During the event, we unveiled a brand-new model, the EC6, a smart premium electric coupe SUV, showcasing our pursuit of both high performance and stylish design in our products. We also launched the all-new ES8, NIO’s flagship model, being well positioned to become the most competitive electric SUV in the mid to large size segment. Furthermore, we will make available a 100-kWh battery pack, which will significantly increase the NEDC driving range of the new ES8, ES6 and EC6 to 580, 610 and 615 kilometers respectively.

“We had delivered over 30,000 vehicles in 296 cities since June 2018, expanded our product offerings to 3 competitive SUV models, and successfully established the only premium EV brand from China. We are proud of our team for the speedy and solid execution. We will continue to drive forward by improving our products and services, enhancing our sales and service network, as well as building our user community,” concluded Mr. Li.

“Facing a continuous soft auto market, we strongly believe the smart premium EV sector will outperform the industry in its growth rate in the foreseeable future. NIO ranked the highest in new vehicle quality among all brands in JD Power’s 2019 New Energy Vehicle Experience Index Study. Additionally, ES6 achieved No.1 in electric SUV sales and top 10 ranking in mid-size premium SUV sales, including ICE and electric vehicle models, in China in October and November. We are pleased to see the momentum continues,” added Wei Feng, NIO’s chief financial officer. “During the quarter, we also implemented comprehensive cost control measures across the organization to improve operational efficiency. As a result, our third quarter SG&A and R&D expenses decreased by 18.1% and 21.3% respectively, compared with the second quarter, and we expect further efficiency gains in the fourth quarter.”

Vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2019 were RMB1,733.5 million (US$242.5 million) in the third quarter of 2019, representing an increase of 22.5% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 21.5% from the same quarter of 2018. The increase in vehicle sales over the second quarter of 2019 was mainly contributed by the sales of ES6s.
 
Other sales in the third quarter of 2019 were RMB103.4 million (US$14.5 million), representing an increase of 9.9% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 142.1% from the same quarter of 2018. The increase in other sales over the second quarter of 2019 was mainly attributed by the increased sales of charging piles and accessories, which was in line with the increase in vehicle deliveries.
 
Total revenues in the third quarter of 2019 were RMB1,836.8 million (US$257.0 million), representing an increase of 21.8% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 25.0% from the same quarter of 2018.
Cost of Sales and Gross Margin

Cost of sales in the third quarter of 2019 was RMB2,058.4 million (US$288.0 million), representing an increase of 2.3% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 29.8% from the same quarter of 2018. The slight increase in cost of sales over the second quarter of 2019 was due to the increase of sales in the third quarter of 2019 and was offset by the decreased cost of sales compared to cost of sales in the second quarter, which included accrued recall costs in relation to the Company’s voluntary recall of 4,803 vehicles announced on June 27, 2019.
 
Vehicle margin in the third quarter of 2019 was negative 6.8%, compared with negative 24.1% in the second quarter of 2019 and negative 4.3% in the same quarter of 2018. The improved vehicle margin was mainly due to the recall costs in the second quarter of 2019 as above mentioned, and the lack thereof in the third quarter of 2019.
 
Gross margin in the third quarter of 2019 was negative 12.1%, compared with negative 33.4% in the second quarter of 2019 and negative 7.9% in the same quarter of 2018. The increase of gross margin over the second quarter of 2019 was mainly due to the improved vehicle margin in the third quarter.

Excluding share-based compensation expenses, adjusted research and development expenses (non-GAAP) were RMB1,003.6 million (US$140.4 million), representing a decrease of 21.7% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 5.9% from the same quarter of 2018. The decrease in research and development expenses over the second quarter of 2019 was primarily attributed to less testing expenses incurred in the third quarter after the initial launch of ES6 in June.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2019 were RMB1,164.4 million (US$162.9 million), representing a decrease of 18.1% from the second quarter of 2019 and a decrease of 30.3% from the same quarter of 2018. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses (non-GAAP) were RMB1,116.3 million (US$156.2 million), representing a decrease of 17.4% from the second quarter of 2019 and a decrease of 15.6% from the same quarter of 2018. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses over the second quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by the Company’s overall cost-saving measures in marketing and other supporting functions.
Loss from Operations

Loss from operations in the third quarter of 2019 was RMB2,409.2 million (US$337.1 million) in the third quarter of 2019, representing a decrease of 25.3% from the second quarter of 2019 and a 14.3% decrease from the same quarter of 2018.

The decrease in share-based compensation expenses over the second quarter of 2019 was primarily due to the continuous decrease of employee numbers, as well as the decreased expenses part of the share-based compensation recognized under the accelerated method.
Net Loss and Earnings Per Share

Net loss was RMB2,521.7 million (US$352.8 million) in the third quarter of 2019, representing a decrease of 23.3% from the second quarter of 2019 and a 10.3% decrease from the same quarter of 2018.

Balance Sheets

Balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB1,960.7 million (US$274.3 million) as of September 30, 2019.
 
The Company operates with continuous loss and negative equity. The Company’s cash balance is not adequate to provide the required working capital and liquidity for continuous operation in the next 12 months. The Company’s continuous operation, which has also constituted the basis of preparing the Company’s third quarter unaudited financial information, depends on the Company’s capability to obtain sufficient external equity or debt financing. The Company is currently working on several financing projects, the consummation of which is subject to certain uncertainties. The Company will announce any material developments or information subject to the requirements by applicable laws.
 
On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC 842 Leases and used the additional transition method to initially apply this new lease standard at the adoption date. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were recognized on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Business Outlook

For the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company expects:

Deliveries of vehicles to be over 8,000 units, representing an increase of over 66.7% from the third quarter of 2019.
 
Total revenues to be approximately RMB2,810 million (US$393.2 million), representing an increase by approximately 53.0% from the third quarter of 2019.
This business outlook reflects the Company’s current and preliminary view on the business situation and market condition, which is subject to change.

Non-GAAP Disclosure

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted cost of sales (non-GAAP), adjusted research and development expenses (non-GAAP), adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses (non-GAAP), adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP), adjusted net loss (non-GAAP), adjusted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders (non-GAAP), adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share (non-GAAP) and adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS (non-GAAP), in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. By excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, accretion on convertible redeemable preferred shares to redemption value and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business and enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss or other consolidated statements of comprehensive loss data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release.
