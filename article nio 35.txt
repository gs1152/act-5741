Revenues

Total revenues in the third quarter of 2021 were RMB9,805.3 million (US$1,521.8 million), representing an increase of 116.6% from the third quarter of 2020 and an increase of 16.1% from the second quarter of 2021.

Vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2021 were RMB8,636.8 million (US$1,340.4 million), representing an increase of 102.4% from the third quarter of 2020 and an increase of 9.2% from the second quarter of 2021. The increase in vehicle sales over the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021 was mainly attributed to the increase of vehicle delivery volume in the third quarter of 2021.

Other sales in the third quarter of 2021 were RMB1,168.5 million (US$181.4 million), representing an increase of 350.8% from the third quarter of 2020 and an increase of 117.9% from the second quarter of 2021. The increase in other sales over the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021 was mainly due to the sales of automotive regulatory credits and battery upgrade service, as well as other revenues which increased in line with the incremental vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2021.
Cost of Sales and Gross Margin

Cost of sales in the third quarter of 2021 was RMB7,812.1 million (US$1,212.4 million), representing an increase of 98.3% from the third quarter of 2020 and an increase of 13.6% from the second quarter of 2021. The increase in cost of sales over the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021 was in line with revenue growth, which was mainly driven by the increase of vehicle delivery volume in the third quarter of 2021.

Gross Profit in the third quarter of 2021 was RMB1,993.2 million (US$309.3 million), representing an increase of 240.3% from the third quarter of 2020 and an increase of 26.6% from the second quarter of 2021.

Gross margin in the third quarter of 2021 was 20.3%, compared with 12.9% in the third quarter of 2020 and 18.6% in the second quarter of 2021. The increase of gross margin compared to the third quarter of 2020 was mainly driven by the increase of vehicle margin and the sales of automotive regulatory credits in the third quarter of 2021. The increase of gross margin compared to the second quarter of 2021 was mainly due to the sales of automotive regulatory credits.

Vehicle margin in the third quarter of 2021 was 18.0%, compared with 14.5% in the third quarter of 2020 and 20.3% in the second quarter of 2021. The increase of vehicle margin compared to the third quarter of 2020 was mainly driven by the higher average selling price, as well as lower material cost. The decrease of vehicle margin compared to the second quarter of 2021 was mainly driven by the increased financing at subsidized rates for vehicle purchases which resulted in a deduction of vehicle revenue and an increase in tooling depreciation cost.
Operating Expenses

Research and development expenses in the third quarter of 2021 were RMB1,193.1 million (US$185.2 million), representing an increase of 101.9% from the third quarter of 2020 and an increase of 35.0% from the second quarter of 2021. Excluding share-based compensation expenses (non-GAAP), research and development expenses were RMB1,095.0 million (US$169.9 million), representing an increase of 89.5% from the third quarter of 2020 and an increase of 36.7% from the second quarter of 2021. The increase of research and development expenses over the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021 was mainly attributed to the increased personnel costs in research and development functions as well as the incremental design and development costs for new products and technologies.

Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2021 were RMB1,824.9 million (US$283.2 million), representing an increase of 94.1% from the third quarter of 2020 and an increase of 21.8% from the second quarter of 2021. Excluding share-based compensation expenses (non-GAAP), selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1,667.5 million (US$258.8 million), representing an increase of 84.2% from the third quarter of 2020 and an increase of 24.7% from the second quarter of 2021. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses over the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021 was primarily due to the increase of personnel costs in sales and service functions and costs related to sales and service network expansion.

Non-GAAP Disclosure

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted cost of sales (non-GAAP), adjusted research and development expenses (non-GAAP), adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses (non-GAAP), adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP), adjusted net loss (non-GAAP), adjusted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders (non-GAAP), adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share (non-GAAP) and adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS (non-GAAP), in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. By excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business and enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss or other consolidated statements of comprehensive loss data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release.
