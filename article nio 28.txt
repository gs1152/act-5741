Financial Results for the Second Quarter of 2020

Revenues

Total revenues were RMB3,718.9 million (US$526.4 million) in the second quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 146.5% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 171.1% from the first quarter of 2020.   
 
Vehicle sales were RMB3,486.1 million (US$493.4 million) in the second quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 146.5% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 177.6% from the first quarter of 2020. The increase in vehicle sales of the second quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of 2019, was mainly contributed by the sales of the ES6 which began deliveries in late June 2019. The increase in vehicle sales of the second quarter of 2020, compared to the first quarter of 2020, was due to the increase of vehicle deliveries recovered from the COVID-19 outbreak in China.
 
Other sales in the second quarter of 2020 were RMB232.8 million (US$33.0 million), representing an increase of 147.7% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 100.0% from the first quarter of 2020. The increase in other sales of the second quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of 2019, was mainly attributed to increased revenues derived from the home chargers installed, service package and energy package subscribed, and accessories sold, which were in line with the increased vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2020.
Cost of Sales and Gross Margin

Cost of sales in the second quarter of 2020 was RMB3,405.8 million (US$482.1 million), representing an increase of 69.2% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 121.2% from the first quarter of 2020. The increase in cost of sales compared to the second quarter of 2019 was mainly driven by the increase of delivery volume of the ES6 and the ES8 in the second quarter of 2020.
 
Gross profit in the second quarter of 2020 was RMB313.1 million (US$44.3 million), representing an increase of RMB817.3 million from a gross loss of RMB504.2 million in the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of RMB480.6 million from a gross loss of RMB167.5 million in the first quarter of 2020. The increase of gross profit compared to the second quarter of 2019 was mainly contributed by increased vehicle sales, and incurrence of the one-off cost in relation to the Company’s voluntary battery recall in the second quarter of 2019.
 
Gross margin in the second quarter of 2020 was 8.4%, compared with negative 33.4% in the second quarter of 2019 and negative 12.2% in the first quarter of 2020. The increase of gross margin compared to the second quarter of 2019 was mainly driven by the increase of vehicle margin in the second quarter of 2020.
 
Vehicle margin in the second quarter of 2020 was 9.7%, compared with negative 24.1% in the second quarter of 2019 and negative 7.4% in the first quarter of 2020. The increase of vehicle margin compared to the second quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 was mainly driven by the decrease in purchase price of certain materials and lower unit manufacturing cost attributed from increased production volume of the ES6 and the ES8 in the second quarter of 2020. Besides above, the increase of vehicle margin in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019 was also attributable to the impact of the one-off cost in relation to the Company’s voluntary battery recall in the second quarter of 2019.
Operating Expenses

Research and development expenses in the second quarter of 2020 were RMB545.2 million (US$77.2 million), representing a decrease of 58.1% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 4.4% from the first quarter of 2020. Excluding share-based compensation expenses (non-GAAP), research and development expenses were RMB533.5 million (US$75.5 million), representing a decrease of 58.4% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 3.7% from the first quarter of 2020. The decrease in research and development expenses over the second quarter of 2019 was primarily attributable to the incurrence of expenses relating to rigorous testing activities of ES6 in the second quarter of 2019 before its mass production. Research and development expenses remained relatively stable compared with the first quarter of 2020, which mainly consisted of costs incurred for recurring projects, while mass investment stage has not yet reached for new projects.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2020 were RMB936.8 million (US$132.6 million), representing a decrease of 34.1% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 10.4% from the first quarter of 2020. Excluding share-based compensation expenses (non-GAAP), selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB904.5 million (US$128.0 million), representing a decrease of 33.1% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 9.7% from the first quarter of 2020. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses over the second quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by the Company’s overall cost-saving efforts and the improved operating efficiency in marketing and other supporting functions. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses over the first quarter of 2020 was primarily attributed to increased marketing and promotional activities and costs recovered from the COVID-19 outbreak in the first quarter of 2020.
Loss from Operations

Loss from operations was RMB1,160.0 million (US$164.2 million) in the second quarter of 2020, representing a decrease of 64.0% from the second quarter of 2019 and a decrease of 26.1% from the first quarter of 2020. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP) was RMB1,114.7 million (US$157.8 million) in the second quarter of 2020, representing a decrease of 64.4% from the second quarter of 2019 and a decrease of 27.5% from the first quarter of 2020.
Share-based Compensation Expenses

Share-based compensation expenses in the second quarter of 2020 were RMB45.3 million (US$6.4 million), representing a decrease of 50.9% from the second quarter of 2019 and an increase of 39.8% from the first quarter of 2020. The decrease in share-based compensation expenses over the second quarter of 2019 was primarily due to less options granted driven by the decline in the number of employees, and the impact of part of the share-based compensation expenses being recognized by using the accelerated method, under which the expenses decrease gradually over the vesting period. The increase in share-based compensation expenses over the first quarter of 2020 was primarily attributed to the incremental options granted in the second quarter of 2020.
Net Loss and Earnings Per Share

Net loss was RMB1,176.7 million (US$166.5 million) in the second quarter of 2020, representing a decrease of 64.2% from the second quarter of 2019 and a decrease of 30.4% from the first quarter of 2020. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, adjusted net loss (non-GAAP) was RMB1,131.4 million (US$160.1 million) in the second quarter of 2020, representing a decrease of 64.6% from the second quarter of 2019 and a decrease of 31.8% from the first quarter of 2020.
 
Net loss attributable to NIO’s ordinary shareholders was RMB1,207.8 million (US$171.0 million) in the second quarter of 2020, representing a decrease of 63.6% from the second quarter of 2019 and a decrease of 29.9% from the first quarter of 2020. Excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, adjusted net loss attributable to NIO’s ordinary shareholders (non-GAAP) was RMB1,131.0 million (US$160.1 million).

Balance Sheets

Balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB11.2 billion (US$1.6 billion) as of June 30, 2020. The Company operates with continuous loss and negative equity. The Company’s continuous operation depends on the successful implementation of the management's plans which considers the improvements in its operating cash flows and the consummation of the investments in NIO China from strategic investors. Based on its evaluation which considers the progress of the investments in NIO China, the Company believes that its existing working capital, the funds from the investments in NIO China and available loan facilities will be sufficient to support the Company's continuous operations and developments in the next twelve months.

For the third quarter of 2020, the Company expects:

Deliveries of the vehicles to be between 11,000 and 11,500 vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 129.2% to 139.6% from the same quarter of 2019, and an increase of approximately 6.5% to 11.3% from the second quarter of 2020.

Non-GAAP Disclosure

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted cost of sales (non-GAAP), adjusted research and development expenses (non-GAAP), adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses (non-GAAP), adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP), adjusted net loss (non-GAAP), adjusted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders (non-GAAP), adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share (non-GAAP) and adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS (non-GAAP), in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. By excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business and enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss or other consolidated statements of comprehensive loss data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release.
