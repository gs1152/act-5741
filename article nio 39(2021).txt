The number of vehicle deliveries provides an indication of the demand for NIO's vehicles as well as the company's ability to scale production. NIO has faced a number of supply chain issues this year, including challenges related to the global semiconductor shortage. The company noted in its Q3 earnings press release that vehicle deliveries for the month of October fell 27.5% YOY. NIO cited upgrades to manufacturing lines, preparations for new products, and volatility in supply chains as reasons for the significant decline in deliveries compared to the same period a year ago.

"Despite the continued supply chain volatilities, our teams and partners are working closely together to secure the supply and production for the fourth quarter of 2021," said William Bin Li, the company's founder, chairman, and chief executive officer.

Total vehicle sales were RMB 8.6 billion, up 102.4% compared to the year-ago quarter. Vehicle sales accounted for about 88% of NIO's total revenue for the quarter. The company's vehicle margin, a measure of gross margin for vehicle sales, was 18.0% compared to 14.5% in the year-ago quarter. When vehicle margin is higher, it means that more vehicle sales are being generated relative to the costs of making those vehicles. NIO said that the YOY rise in its vehicle margin was primarily driven by higher average selling prices and lower material costs.

NIO Vehicle Delivery and Revenue Outlook
NIO expects vehicle deliveries for Q4 FY 2021 to be between 23,500 and 25,500, which would represent a YOY increase of approximately 35.4% to 46.9%. It expects revenue to rise between 41.2% and 52.2% compared to the fourth quarter of FY 2020.

NIO's next earnings report (for Q4 FY 2021) is estimated to be released on Feb. 28, 2022.
